# Tools

## Dependency Management

- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) - Carthage is intended to be the simplest way to add frameworks to your Cocoa application. Carthage builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks, but you retain full control over your project structure and setup. Carthage does not automatically modify your project files or your build settings.
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) - CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 58 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.
- [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) - The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies. The Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

## Linting
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
